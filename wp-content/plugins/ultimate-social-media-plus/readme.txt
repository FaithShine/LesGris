Super-easy to use social media plugin which adds sharing buttons to your website with tons of customization features! 

== Description ==

This plugin makes placing social media icons on your site REALLY easy. 

Key features: 

- Select from a **wide range of social media platforms** (see a list of them below)
- Pick from **16 stylish design styles** for your social icons 
- Place the icons **before or after posts, floating, via widget, via shortcode, or define the location on the page** (top right, bottom left etc.) 
- Give **several actions to one icon** (e.g. your Facebook icon can lead visitors to your Facebook page, and also show a Facebook like button to allow visitors to like your page)
- Give your icons an **animation** (e.g. automatic shuffling, mouse-over effects) to make your visitors aware of them, increasing the chance that they follow, like or share your site
- Add **counts** to your buttons
- Display a **pop-up** (on all or only on selected pages) asking people to follow or share you
- Allow visitors to **subscribe to your site** and receive new posts automatically by email 
- Select from **many other customization features** for your icons

The plugin takes you through eight easy-to-answer questions so that configuring the plugin becomes a no-brainer: 

= Question 1: Which icons do you want to display? =

You can also upload custom icons of your choice.

If there are any important social media networks not covered yet, please let us know!

= Question 2: What shall the icons do? =

Under this question you define what should happen if your visitors click on the icons. 

The options are plenty, for example for the *Facebook button* you can allow users to: 

* **Visit** your Facebook page
* Give your page a **Facebook Like**
* **Share it** with friends (on Facebook)

For the *Twitter button* you can allow users to: 
* **Visit** you on Twitter
* **Follow you** on Twitter (without leaving your page)
* **Tweet** your page to the Twitter community

For the *Youtube button* you can allow users to: 
* **Visit** you on Youtube
* **Subscribe** to you on Youtube (just by pressing the Youtube button, without leaving your page)

For the *Pinterest button* you can allow users to: 
* **Visit** you on Pinterest
* **Pin** your site on Pinterest 

For the *LinkedIn button* you can allow users to: 
* **Visit** your LinkedIn page
* **Follow you** on LinkedIn (without leaving your website)
* **Share** your page on LinkedIn
* **Recommend** your business or product on LinkedIn

For the *Google+ button* you can allow users to: 

* **Visit** your Google+ page
* Give your page a **"Google+ like"**
* **Share it** with friends (on Google+)


The other social buttons provide similar functions. If you’ve given one icon several functions then users will see a little popup (tooltip) where they can select what they want to do. 


= Question 3: Where shall the icons be displayed? =

Now it’s time to define where the social media icons should show up. You can select to show them: 

* **Via widget**: In the widget are you’ll see the social media widget where you can drag & drop it onto your sidebar or footer area.
* **Float on the page**: You can define the location, e.g. top right, center left etc., and the margins from the top/bottom/left/right. They will appear as flying icons which move as the user scrolls down.
* **Manually**: Place the sharing icons via shortcode [DISPLAY_ULTIMATE_PLUS] or insert a php string into your theme. 
* **Show the icons before or after posts**: Here you can select the icons to show before or after posts. You can choose to show the icons you selected above (round/squared layout), or pick from a different (rectangle) set of share icons. You can also define a text before the icons, e.g. “Please follow and share us!” and define the alignment of the icons (left/right/center).


*The following questions are optional only, however most likely you will want to go through them to individualize the icon’s appearance even more:* 

= Question 4: What design & animation do you want to give your icons? =

Here you can define how the sharing icons should look like. You can select from 16 design options (see screenshots). 

You can also give any social media icon mouse-over effects, such as “fading effects” (icons fade in/out if moved over), “scale” (icons become larger if moved over) or “combo” (combination of the previous two). 

If you want to give a subtle hint to your visitors to share, like or follow your site, then you can animate your social media buttons, for example you can let them shuffle automatically (e.g. when the site first loads, or after X seconds as defined by you).   


= Question 5: Do you want to display counts next to your icons? =

Under this question you can decide to display counts next to your icons. All icons have the option to show manual counts, however for some icons automatic options are available. 

For example, for your Facebook button you can show the number of times the page got liked where the icon is on (i.e. your site), or the number of likes count of your Facebook page. 

For the Googleplus button similar options are available. For the Twitter button you can show the number of your followers on Twitter, which gets updated dynamically. 


= Question 6: Any other wishes for your main sharing icons? =

Here you get many other options to tailor the icons to your needs. For example, you can: 

* Define the order of your social network icons
* Define the size of your social network icons
* Define the space between the social network buttons
* Define the alignment of icons (with respect to each other)
* Decide how many social media logos should be displayed per row
* Pick a language for your visit us / like / follow icons 
* Decide to open windows in a new window (or same window)
* Make icons stick (if placed via widget, so still visible if user scrolls down)
* Disable float share buttons on mobile devices
* Disable auto-scaling feature for mobile devices (“viewport” meta tag)
* Give your social media butons mouse-over texts


= Question 7: Do you want to display a pop up? =

A pop-up can make it more likely that your visitors share, follow or like your site (or connect with you). Therefore you can decide to show such a popup containing your social networks icons, and define…
* *The layout of the pop up*, i.e. displayed text, font type, font style, font color, background color, border color, border thickness, and border shadow.  
* *Where the pop-up shall be shown*, i.e. on ever page, on blog posts only, or on selected pages only. 
* *When the pop-up shall be shown*, i.e. once every X seconds after the user arrived on the site, or every time the user scrolls to the end of the page. 


= Question 8: Do you want to show a subscription form? =

In addition to an email button you can also place a subscription form on your site, making it more likely that users subscribe and follow your site. It works in a similar way as a newsletter (using RSS technology, but not linked to your RSS button). 

You can define the detailed layout of the subscription form, and have various options how to place it (via widget, shortcodes, or by copy/pasting HTML code on your site).
